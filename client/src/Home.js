           <blockquote className='col-md-3'> Navigating the internet can be a challenge at my age. There's so many different websites that can be hard to understand. One Up Eldercare is an easy to use website that let me see all the places around me so I could make a smart choice. I can't recommend it enough! <span> Sam H. </span> </blockquote>
            <blockquote className='col-md-3'> I went to a few different websites trying to find the information I needed on nursing homes. All the websites were outdated or had missing information and were really hard to navigate. Then I found One Up Eldercare and it was the first website that was easy to use and had everything I was looking for. It really is the only place to go to get all the info you need on nursing homes! <span> Jamil L. </span> </blockquote>
